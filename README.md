# Chapter 1 Quests

*1.* _Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words:_
* The captial "B" Blockchain is digital information storage with added functionalities: built in history + records, hard to hack, open and accessable to everyone _(you can more directly build + interact with information here than elsewhere online. This is becuase the source information is public not just the visualized information.)_, and more robust or permanent _(if one company who is on closes up shop, even if they're big, the blockchain isn't folding with them)_. 

*2.* _Explain what a Smart Contract is:_
* A smart contract is a defined ruleset on the blockchain that can be engaged with. They are the roads that define engaging with the blockchain!

*3.* _Explain the difference between a script and a transaction:_
* A script is logic run on a computer to generate a result. A transaction is the declaration of logic on the blockchain that is run only if it passes requirements set up in its request. The difference between a script and a transaction is that a script is not necissarily run on the blockchain while a transaction must be and a script doesn't need to pass external requirements to be run (often the requirments are money related for transactions - "do you have enough currency on the blockchain to run this transaction?")
